# Initial Evaluation Report for Financial Datasets

## Overview
This report provides an evaluation of five financial datasets: **FinQA**, **TAT-QA**, **TheoremQA**, **BizBench**, and **FinanceMATH**. We focus on their suitability for complex numerical reasoning tasks.

## Dataset Quality
- **FinQA**: The dataset is comprehensive but contains some inconsistencies in question phrasing, which may confuse models.
- **TAT-QA**: Data quality is generally high, but there are occasional ambiguities in financial terminology.
- **TheoremQA**: The dataset is well-structured for theorem proving but may require advanced reasoning skills for certain proofs.
- **BizBench**: Contains case study questions, which can sometimes lack sufficient context.
- **FinanceMATH**: High-quality data for quantitative finance problems but may be too specialized for general tasks.

## Suitability for Numerical Reasoning
- **FinQA**: Well-suited for general financial analysis, but may not handle deep mathematical computations effectively.
- **TAT-QA**: Great for tasks requiring understanding of financial statements but lacks complex mathematical reasoning tasks.
- **TheoremQA**: Excellent for reasoning tasks involving pure mathematical proofs, especially in abstract areas.
- **BizBench**: Suitable for business decision-making, but lacks deep numerical reasoning tasks.
- **FinanceMATH**: Ideal for complex mathematical finance problems, including risk modeling and derivatives pricing.

## Conclusion
Each dataset has strengths and weaknesses depending on the task. A key takeaway is that while **FinanceMATH** excels in quantitative reasoning, **BizBench** is more focused on decision-making and business strategy rather than numerical calculations.
